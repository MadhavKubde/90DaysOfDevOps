# Day 4 Task: Basic Linux Shell Scripting for DevOps Engineers

## What is Kernel?

The kernel is a computer program that is the core of a computer’s operating system, with complete control over everything in the system.

## What is Shell?

A shell is a special user program that provides an interface for users to interact with operating system services. It accepts human-readable commands from users and converts them into instructions that the kernel can understand. The shell is a command language interpreter that executes commands read from input devices such as keyboards or from files. It starts when the user logs in or opens a terminal.

## What is Linux Shell Scripting?

Linux shell scripting involves writing programs (scripts) that can be run by a Linux shell, such as bash (Bourne Again Shell). These scripts automate tasks, perform system administration tasks, and facilitate the interaction between users and the operating system.

**Tasks:**

Explain in your own words and with examples what Shell Scripting means for DevOps.
- For DevOps engineers, shell scripting is like having a personal assistant that handles routine tasks. By writing a script, you 
  can automate processes like server setup, deployments, log analysis, and backups. For example:
- Automating a daily backup of log files to a secure location.
- Deploying a new version of an application by running a script that pulls the latest code and restarts the service.
- Monitoring system health by writing a script that checks server disk space and sends alerts when it’s low.

What is `#!/bin/bash`? Can we write `#!/bin/sh` as well?
- #!/bin/bash : This is called a shebang. It tells the system to use the bash interpreter to run the script.
- #!/bin/sh : This uses the sh interpreter, which is more basic compared to bash but still effective for many scripts.
- Both are commonly used, but bash offers more features and is the default on many Linux systems, making it a preferred choice v 
  for complex scripts.
  
Write a Shell Script that prints `I will complete #90DaysOfDevOps challenge`.
